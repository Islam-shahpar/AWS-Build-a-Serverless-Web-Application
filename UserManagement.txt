Introduction :
	- Create an Amazon Cognito user pool to manage user's accounts.
	- Deploy pages that enable customers
		- to register as a new user
			- Require an email and password (additional options can be added)
		- verify the email address
			- Cognito will send a confirmation email with verification code
		- sign into the site
			- Providing email and password 
			- A JS function communicates with Amazon Cognito, authenticates Secure Remote Password Protocol (SRP)
			- Receives back a set of JSON Web Token (JWT)

Implementation Instruction :

1. Create a amazon cognito user pool :
	- Services -> Cognito -> Manage your User Pools -> Create a User Pool
	- Provide a name for the user pool : "WildRydes" -> Select Review Defaults
	- On the review page -> Create pool
	- Note the Pool Id on the pool details page of newly created user pool

2. Add an app to the user pool :
	- Pool Details page -> General Settings -> App Client
	- Add an app client -> name the app "WildRydesWebApp"
	- Uncheck "Generate Client Secret Option" (This is currently not supported for browser-based app)
	- Choose "Create App client"
	- Note the "App Clinet ID" for the newly created application

3. Update the /js/config.js in Website bucket
	- update the newly created user pool ID, app client ID, Region
	- Download the config.js file from the bucket
	- Update the cognito section with the correct value:
		- userPoolId
		- userPoolClientId	
		- region: us-east-1
	- updated config file should look like below;

window._config = {
	cognito: {
		userPoolId: 'us-east-1_uXboG5pAb',
		userPoolClientId: '25ddkmj4v6hfsfvruhpfi7n4hv',
		region: 'us-east-1'
	},
	api: {
		invokeUrl: ''// e.g. https://rc7nyt4tql.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod',
	}
};

	- save the file a config.js
 	- open S3 console
	- select wildryde website bucket
	- browse to js prefix
	- upload -> add files
	- select config.js and upload

4. Verify Implementation:
	- Visit /register.html by clicking on "Giddy Up"
	- Sign up using real/fake email address 
	- Password should contains at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 number, 1 special character
	- Confirm new user:
	- for real email address -> go to /verify.html -> enter the verification code
		(For real deployment use SES to send email to clients)
	- for fake email address go through aws console
	- go to cognito -> Manage your User Pools -> WildRydes user pool -> Left navigation bar -> Users and Groups
	- choose the corresponding email username and click to see the detail
	- Choose confirm user to finalize the action
	- /verify.html or /signin.html try signing in
	- If successful, should be redirected to /ride.html
	- You should see notification that API is not configured
