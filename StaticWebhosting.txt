Introduction :
	- Configure S3 to host static resources for web application.
	- All the static web content including HTML,CSS,JS,images and other files will be stored in S3.
	- End user will access site using public URL exposed by Amazon S3.
	- No web server needed in order to make website available.
	- Endpoint URL : http://{your-bucket-name}.s3-website.{region}.amazonaws.com
	- For real application it is recommended to use a custom domain to host the site.
	- For custome domain tutorial : Setting up a static website using a custom domain in the Amazon S3 documentation.

Implementation Instruction :

Console Step-by-step:

1. Select a Region: US East (N. Virginia)
2. Create an S3 bucket:
	- Use the console / AWS CLI to create an S3 bucket
	- name the bucket as "wildrydes-firstname-lastname"
	- Create the bucket
3. Upload Content :
	- Download the file from the link
	- Unzip the archived file
	- Select the bucket
	- Ensure you are viewing the overview tab
	- Browse to WebApplication/1_StaticWebHosting/website directory
	- select all the files and subfolders under the directory
	- Drag and drop the files into the overview tab of S3
	- Click on upload

CLI step-by-step :

1. Copy the necesary file from s3://wildrydes-us-east-1/WebApplication/1_StaticWebHosting/website to S3 bucket
	- aws s3 sync s3://wildrydes-us-east-1/WebApplication/1_StaticWebHosting/website s3://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME --region YOUR_BUCKET_REGION

4. Add a bucket policy to allow public reads :
	- Bucket policies are JSON document that specify what priniciples are allowed to execute various actions against the objects in your bucket.
	- In this policy we will allow anonymous users view our site.
	- By default, the bucket is only accessible by authenticated users with access to our AWS account.
	- Select the bucket, choose the permission tab, then select the bucket policy.
	- In the permission tab : 
	- Make sure public access setting is selected
	- Click on edit and uncheck "Block new public bucket policies" and "Block public and cross-account access if bucket has public access.
	- Choose bucket policy:
	- Enter the following policy replacing [YOUR_BUCKET_NAME] with the name of the bucket

{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement":[
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": "*",
			"Action": "s3:GetObject",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::[YOUR_BUCKET_NAME]/*"
		}
	]
}

	- Choose save and apply new policy.


5. Enable Website Hosting :
	- In order to serve asets from the root URL (/index.html), we need to enabe hosting on the bucket
	- S3 -> Propertires tab -> Static website hosting -> Use this bucket to host a website -> enter index.html
	- leave the error document blank
	- Note the endpoint URL at the top of the dialog before choosing save. This URL is the base-url
	- Save

6. Validate hosting :
	- Paste the website endpoint URL for S3 bucket
	- Static web hosting -> properties -> find the base-url
	- If the page show properly -> move to the next section "User Management".
